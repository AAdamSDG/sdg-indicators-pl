Furthermore, for the calculation of the electricity from renewable energy sources consumed by electric road vehicles, that consumption shall be considered to be 2.5 times the energy content of the input of electricity from renewable energy sources.Some of the definitions in the Directive 2009/28/EC differ from those used in the Polish energy statistics. Thus, the term &#39 biofuels&#39  for transport is extended to &#39 fuel gas&#39  produced from biomass.Energy from renewable sources is the energy derived from natural, repetitive environmental processes, obtained from renewable non-fossil energy sources (energy: water, wind, solar heat, geothermal heat, waves, sea currents and tides and energy obtained from biomass, biogas, biofuels).Gross final energy consumption is a final consumption of energy carriers by the consumers (industry, transport sector, service sector, households, agriculture, forestry and fishery sector) including electricity and heat consumption by industry for electricity and heat generation as well as transformation and distribution losses.","zrodlo_danych":"Eurostat","czestotliwosc_dostÄ™pnosc_danych":"Annual data  since 2010","uwagi":null}
