The Genetic Resources Protection Program in Poland covers the following breeds of animals: - 4 breeds of cattle, - 3 breeds of pigs, - 7 breeds of horses, - 15 breeds of sheep, - 14 geese breeds, - 11 breeds of laying hens, - 10 ducks breeds, - 4 breeds of fur animals - and 5 lines of bees.There are the following methods to protect the animal population from extinction: - in situ - the protection of living animals in their natural environment, - ex-situ-protection of genetic resources beyond their natural habitat, including: ex-situ in vitro - cryopreserved material in banks of genetic material, ex situ in vivo - collections of live animals kept away from the place of occurrence.","zrodlo_danych":"Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development / National Research Institute of Animal Production","czestotliwosc_dostÄ™pnosc_danych":"Annual data  since 2015","uwagi":"The original indicator, adopted by the UN for monitoring target 2.5 is the indicator 2.5.2 Proportion of local breeds, classified as being at risk, not-at-risk or unknown level of risk of extinction."}
