In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least: 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9%), 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost.No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA.Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients.Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. The ODA indicator is presented as net disbursement, although the UN methodology does not specify this.Due to the current revision of ODA, it is expected that from 2018 the indicator will be presented as a grant equivalent including only the grant element multiplied by the value of a given flow. As a result, there will be no differentiation into net and gross ODA. Additionally, some methodological activities are being conducted to incorporate other flows into ODA, such as mobilised amount of money by the public sector from the private sector instruments. Furthermore, an alternative to ODA, TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) is being developed as an instrument for measuring means for SDGs implementation.Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies.The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2016-2020 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on Eastern Partnership countries (Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine) as well as Africa, Asia and Middle East (Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania, Myanmar and Palestine).Polish development cooperation supports strengthening the rule of law, decentralization reforms and combat against corruption as well as human and civil rights compliance. Its main objectives cover the improvement of health care, better access to education and support for entrepreneurship and agriculture as well as natural environment protection including natural disasters prevention. Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other ministries.The State Budget constitutes a part of budgetary act and determines: the total amount of projected tax revenues and non-tax revenues of state budget  the total amount of planned budget expenditure  the amount of the planned state budget deficit together with the sources of its coverage  the total amount of projected revenues of the European Funds Budget  total amount of planned budget expenditures of the European Funds Budget  the financial result of the European Funds Budget  the total amount of planned income of the state budget  the total amount of planned expenditures of the state budget  the planned balance of revenues and expenditures of the state budget  limit for liabilities incurred on loans and securities issued.","zrodlo_danych":"Ministry of Finance Republic of Poland / Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of Poland /","czestotliwosc_dostÄ™pnosc_danych":"Annual data  Since 2010.","uwagi":"An original indicator, adopted by the UN for monitoring target 17.3 of the 2030 Agenda is 17.3.1 Foreign direct investments (FDI), official development assistance and South-South Cooperation as a proportion of total domestic budget .The indicator does not include South-South Cooperation and Foreign direct investments (FDI).","indicator_variable_1":"total","kategorie":null,"zmienne":null,"jednostka":"percent","pre":1,"graph":"longitudinal","source_url":"www.stat.gov.pl","permalink":"/en/statistics_glob/17-3-1/","sdg_goal":17,"indicator":"17.3.1","target_id":"17.3.1","graph_title":"Official development assistance (ODA) as a proportion of total domestic budget"}
