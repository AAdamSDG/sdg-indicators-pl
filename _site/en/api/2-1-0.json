A crude population measure of obesity is the body mass index (BMI). A person with a BMI of 30 or more is generally considered obese.Body mass index (BMI) is defined as a person s weight in kilograms divided by the square of the person s height in metres (kg/m2).For adults over 20 years old, BMI falls into one of the following categories: &lt  18.5 – underweight, 18.5 – 24.9 – normal weight, 25.0 – 29.9 – pre-obesity, 30.0 – 34.9 – obesity class I, 35.0 – 39.9 – obesity class II, &ge  40 – obesity class III.The BMI ranges are based on the effect excessive body fat has on disease and death and are reasonably well related to adiposity. BMI was developed as a risk indicator of disease  as BMI increases, so does the risk for some diseases. Some common conditions related to overweight and obesity include: premature death, cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, some cancers and diabetes.","zrodlo_danych":"World Health Organization","czestotliwosc_dostępnosc_danych":"Annual data  since 2010","uwagi":"null"}
