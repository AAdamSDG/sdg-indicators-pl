For example, the 34% value of this indicator means that the GDP value per capita in all subregions (weighted by the share of the number of population) differs from the national value by 34% on average. Assuming the permanent structure of the number of the population by subregions, there will be increase in the value of the indicator as long as the differences of GDP per capita between subregions continue to increase.Gross domestic product (GDP) illustrates the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy (resident producer units – domestic) in a given year. The exact definition and methodology for calculating GDP is contained in the regulation (EU) No 549/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the European Union (ESA 2010).","zrodlo_danych":"Statistics Poland","czestotliwosc_dostępnosc_danych":"Annual data  since 2010","uwagi":null}
