Respondents were selected using the random sampling method. The routine interviews during the study included questions about physical, sexual and psychological violence, including domestic violence. The study also included questions about persistent harassment (stalking), sexual harassment, the role of new technologies in abuse-related experiences and victimisation in childhood.</br>\nIn the FRA study, women were asked to identify the events that took place after 15 years of age (during a specified life period) and events from the 12 months preceding the interview.</br>\nQuestions concerning violence by a partner refer to any acts of violence which took place during the relationship. Respondents are considered to have a current partner if they are married, in a recognised civil partnership or registered partnership, living together with a partner without being married, or involved in a relationship with a partner without living together. Respondents who have previously had one of the above-mentioned partners are considered to have had a previous partner. Results referring to women’s experiences with any partner are based on the responses of those respondents who have a current partner or who have had at least one previous partner.","zrodlo_danych":"European Union Agency for Fundamental Right","czestotliwosc_dostępnosc_danych":"Data for 2012","uwagi":null}
