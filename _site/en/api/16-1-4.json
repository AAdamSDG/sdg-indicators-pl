Central Statistical Office of Poland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005.The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household).Respondents were asked \"How safe do you feel to be alone in your neighborhood after dark?\" Possible answers were: very safe, rather safe, rather dangerous, very dangerous, do not go alone after dark, because I feel dangerous, do not go alone after dark for other reasons. To calculate the indicator, the category do not go alone after dark, because I feel dangerous was excluded.","zrodlo_danych":"Statistics Poland","czestotliwosc_dostępnosc_danych":"Annual data  Since 2015.","uwagi":null}
