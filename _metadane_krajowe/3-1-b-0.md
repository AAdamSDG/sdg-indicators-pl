  <p>Data on healthy life years come from the <strong>EU-SILC questionnaire
  survey - EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions</strong> (Division 7.
  Health of the EU-SILC individual questionnaire). The survey covers adult
  <strong>persons aged 16 and more in a households</strong>.</p> <p><strong>EU
  Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC)</strong> is the
  instrument which focuses on providing current and comparable at the Member
  States level data on income, poverty, social exclusion, living conditions and
  health state.</p> <p>It is a questionnaire survey carried out every year (with
  the use of the panel method in the four-year cycle which makes it possible to
  analyze changes in social phenomena and in the period of time covered by the
  survey).The organization and methodology of the survey is governed by the
  Regulation (EC) No. 1177/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
  16 June 2003 concerning Community Statistics on Income and Living Conditions
  (EU-SILC). EU-SILC survey was implemented in the European Union in the years
  2004-2007, and in Poland it has been conducted since 2005.</p> <p><strong>The
  survey method</strong> - EU-SILC is a non-obligatory, representative
  questionnaire survey of individual households, carried out by the face-to-face
  interview technique. For individual interviews a proxy interview is allowed
  with another household member who is able to provide reliable information
  concerning the person who should be covered by the survey (this is applicable
  to the household members who are absent in the place of residence at the time
  of the survey).</p> <p><strong>HLY indicator</strong> serves to measure the
  number of years that a person lives in a healthy condition. &nbsp;It combines
  information on age-specific mortality (age-specific deaths) and vulnerability
  to diseases (age-specific proportions of the population in healthy and
  unhealthy condition). A healthy condition is defined as one without limitation
  in everyday functioning and without disability. This statistical indicator is
  compiled separately for men and women.</p> <p><strong>The Healthy Life Years
  (HLY)</strong> indicator is one of European Structural Indicators and refers
  to health as a factor connected with the development and well-being. HLY
  indicator has been developed as a result of observation that not all years,
  defined by expected length of life, are lived in a healthy condition.</p>
  <p><strong>The HLY indicator level</strong> - as other measures of the
  expected health state - is calculated following the Sullivan method widely
  used since the 70s. The method is based on measures of frequency of disability
  in the population of a given age (the self-perceived disability) and on
  mortality tables.</p>
