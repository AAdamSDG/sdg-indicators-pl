  Income quintile inequality ratio is calculated for equivalised annual disposable income of households and its members. It is the ratio of the equivalised disposable income after social transfers of people belonging in the fifth (top) income quintile to the equivalised disposable income after social transfers of those belonging in the first (lowest) income quintile. This indicator is calculated forDisposable income is defined as a sum of the net (after deduction of income tax prepayment, tax on income from property, social and health insurance contributions) annual monetary incomes (in case of hired employment taking into account also non-monetary profit from the use of the company car) gained by all the household members reduced by: property tax, inter-household cash transfers paid and balance of offsetting settlements with the Tax Office.The equivalence scales are the parameters which allow to compare the conditions of households of different sizes and different demographic structures. They show an impact of the demographic structure on the household s costs of living. For the calculation of income statistics the modified OECD equivalence scale was applied which is calculated as follows: 1 – for the first adult household member, 0.5 – for the second and each subsequent household member aged 14 and over, 0.3 – for every child in the household under 14.Household is a group of persons related to each other by kinship or not, living together and sharing their income and expenditure (multi-person household) or a single person, not sharing his/her income or expenditure with any other person, whether living alone or with other persons (one-person household).
