  Compensation of employees - wages and salaries, contributions to social security paid by employers increased by contributions for the Labour Fund as well as other costs connected with employment, e.g.: awards, funded scholarships, bonuses not included in wages and salaries as well as company social benefit fund, travelling allowances, parliamentary allowances, which in case of households sector are defined as ”other income connected with hired work”. Wages and salaries concern amounts booked in activity costs for a given period and, therefore, do not include payments from profit and balance surplus in cooperatives.Gross domestic product (GDP) presents the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy. GDP is equal to the sum of gross value added generated by all national institutional units, increased by taxes on products and decreased by subsidies on products. Gross domestic product is calculated according to obligatory in the European Union countries principles of the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) and recommendations of the Eurostat.
