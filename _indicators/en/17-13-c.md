  Gross fixed capital formation is the expenditure which increases the value of tangible fixed assets (buildings and structures, machinery, technical equipment and tools, transport equipment and other fixed assets), excluding expenditure comprising the initial investments as well as interest on investment credits and loans for the period of investment realization. The account includes also expenditure on: a) intellectual property products, intended for use for a period longer than 1 year – in particular expenditure on research and development and on computer software (purchased or produced for own final use)  b) small tools that are used in the production longer than 1 year – regardless of their value  c) weapons systems (e.g., tanks, armored vehicles, warships, submarines).The indicator is calculated according to being in force in the countries of the European Union methodology ESA 2010 (European System of National and Regional Accounts), implemented by the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) No 549/2013 of 21 May 2013, which replaced the previous methodology ESA 1995. Data presented in Strateg system have been converted back with regard to methodological changes made. One of the key changes introduced by ESA 2010 relates to the registration in gross fixed capital formation (not, as previously, in intermediate consumption) the expenditure on research development investment and expenses for small tools – in all institutional sectors, and also expenditure on weapons systems – in the general government sector.Gross domestic product (GDP) illustrates the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy (resident producer units – domestic) in a given year. The exact definition and methodology for calculating GDP is contained in the regulation (EU) No 549/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the European Union (ESA 2010).
