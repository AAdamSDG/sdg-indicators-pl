  The indicator defines the state of conservation of livestock genetic resources ex situ in vitro and ex situ in vivo. There are the following methods to protect the animal population from extinction: - in situ - the protection of living animals in their natural environment, - ex-situ-protection of genetic resources beyond their natural habitat, including: ex-situ in vitro - cryopreserved material in banks of genetic material, ex situ in vivo - collections of live animals kept away from the place of occurrence In the case of ex situ in vivo collections, in order to be considered long-term and stable it is assumed that they are in public sector institutions.
