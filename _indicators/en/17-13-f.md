  Result (deficit or surplus) of the general government sector is the net borrowing or net lending of the sector, adjusted for interest flows on swap transactions (swaps are contractual arrangements between two parties who agree to exchange, over time and according to predetermined rules, streams of payment on the same amount of indebtedness).The indicator is calculated according to being in force in the countries of the European Union methodology ESA 2010 (European System of National and Regional Accounts), implemented by the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) No 549/2013 of 21 May 2013. ESA 2010 in scope of definitions, principles, entries and classifications is generally coherent with the international system of national accounts – 2008 SNA (System of National Accounts of United Nations). Differences between ESA and SNA (mostly in the way of account’s presentation) arise from the specificity of the national accounts system in the European Union, which requires greater precision in definitions and in accounting rules.The indicator is calculated taking into account the internal consolidation within the general government sector, which entails eliminating transfers within the sector. Such recognition eliminates the multiple counting of certain amounts and ensures the correct calculation of the result of the entire sector, as it ignores the borrowing or lending of general government units towards entities belonging to the same sector.Information about the result of the general government sector is consistent with data compiled according to Council Regulation (EC) No. 479/2009 of 25 general government debt May 2009 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community, with later amendments.General government sector – according to the ESA2010 – includes the following entities of the national economy: a) entities operating according to principles described in Law on Public finances (budgetary units, appropriated funds and since 2010 also local budgetary establishments, executive agencies and budget institutions as well as until 2005 special funds of budgetary entities, in 2005–2010 – own income account of budgetary entities and until 2010 – budgetary establishments and auxiliary units of budgetary entities including conducting economic activity ones as well as motivation funds), b) entities for which the financial system was defined in special regulations, and for which the subsidies from the state budget are the main source of financing (public higher education institutions, the Polish Academy of Science and entities established by it, the National Road Fund and other funds managed by Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego, agriculture advisory units and state agencies), c) independent public self-government health care facilities, d) state and local government institutions of culture and national film institutions, e) funds with the legal personality which are connected with state or local government units budgets, f) institutions managing the social security funds (SII, ASIF) and these funds as well as the National Health Fund (in the period 1 I 1999—31 III 2003 — health funds), g) public hospitals in the form of limited liability companies and hospitals acting as research institutes (excluded from non-financial corporations sector), h) Bank Guarantee Fund (excluded from financial corporations sector), i) other units, including public corporations and non-commercial institutions that meet ESA 2010 classification criteria to general government sector.Gross domestic product (GDP) illustrates the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy (resident producer units – domestic) in a given year. The exact definition and methodology for calculating GDP is contained in the regulation of the Parliament and of the Council (EU) No 549/2013 of 21 May 2013 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the European Union (ESA 2010).
