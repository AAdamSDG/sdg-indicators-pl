  The indicator measures the amount of energy needed to produce unit of gross domestic product. It is expressed in kilograms of equivalent oil per 1000 Euro. Decrease of energy consumption means that less energy is needed to produce the same value of GDP and is connected with higher energy efficiency. This indicator does not reflect on actual disproportion of energy efficiency of Polish and EU economies, due to differences in purchasing power, which inter alia mean that the level of prices of goods and market and non-market services in individual countries is diversified (Euro purchasing power is greater in Poland than EU average). Differences in energy consumption in Poland and EU on physical level (e.g. use of energy for the production of tone of the product) are considerably lower.Gross energy consumption comprises the amount of individual energy carriers delivered to domestic market (obtained + import – export), reduced by balance of domestic stocks.kgoe – kilogram of oil equivalent (conventional) – energy measurement unit used in international balances. It means the amount of energy that can be produced by burning one metric kilogram of crude petroleum. One tonne of conventional oil equals 41,868 GJ or 11,63 MWh.
