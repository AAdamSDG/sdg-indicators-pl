  For the purposes of air quality assessment, Poland has been divided into 46 zones, in which the air quality assessment is made in accordance to the Regulation of the Minister of the Environment of 2 August 2012 on the zones where a quality assessment is made (Journal of Laws from 2012, item 914). Accordingly for each of the 46 zones, annual assessment of the quality of the air is performed in terms of protection of human health as regards 12 pollutants (SO2, NO2, benzene, CO, O3, particulate matter PM 10, particulate matter PM 2,5, arsenic, cadmium, lead, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene) and on the basis of this assessment zones are classified for each pollutant. To calculate the index overall evaluation of the class of zone is taken basing on the criteria defined for health protection for all pollutants for which air quality standard or acceptable level is specified (this applies to the results of the classification of zones for SO2, NO2, benzene, CO, PM10 dust and PM2.5 dust). The zone is included in zones in which in a given year the standard of air quality exceedance occurred if the acceptable level of tolerance enlarged by the margin of tolerance was exceeded on the area of the zone for one or more of the above mentioned pollutants. To calculate the air quality exceedances determined on the basis of the target level are not taken into account, since in accordance with the Act of 27 April 2001 – the Environmental Protection Law (Journal of Laws from 2013, item 1232, with later amendments) the target level is not a standard for air quality. The calculation result is given in percent applying the formula: Air quality indicator = (number of areas with exceedance of the permissible level / 46)&bull 100

uwagi: >-
  The division of the country into zones changed three times in the last 10 years which was connected with changes in the EU law. Number of zones of 362 in 2003-2006, by 170 in 2007-2009, decreased to 46 from 2010 onwards. Additionally, from 2010 the evaluation begun to include particulate matter PM2.5. In order to maintain comparability of results air quality index is calculated since 2011 and the first data that were used for calculations were the data concerning the classification of zones for the year 2010.
