  Levels of recycling and preparation for re-use of the following fractions: paper, metals, plastic and glass, as well as ways of calculating those levels are set out in the Regulation of the Minister of the Environment of 29 May 2012 on the levels of recycling, preparation for re-use and recovery of other methods of some fraction of municipal waste (Journal of Laws from 2012 No 0, item 645).Level of recycling and preparation for re-use of paper, metals, plastic and glass are calculated jointly for all mentioned fractions of municipal waste.When calculating the joint mass of above mentioned waste fractions the wastes bearing the following codes should be taken into consideration: 15 01 01, 15 01 02, 15 01 04, 15 01 06, 15 01 07, 20 01 01, 20 01 02, 20 01 39, 20 01 40, ex 20 01 99 – paper, metals, plastic and glass waste, according to Regulation of the Minister of the Environment of 27 September 2001 r. on waste catalogue (Journal of Laws No 12, item 61206).The gminas are required by the means of this Regulation to achieve certain recycling levels by 31 December 2020 and to prepare the methods of its calculation, which will allow the verification of targets fulfillment in the following years. In the case of paper, metals, plastic and glass waste, gaminas are required to achieve levels of at least 50% of recycling and preparation for re-use.Recycling is a recovery as consists in reprocessing of substances or materials contained in waste through a production process to recover substances or materials for their original or different uses. It includes renewed processing of organic material (organic recycling). It excludes energy recovery and renewed processing to materials that can be used as fuels or for the purposes of filling in the excavations.Recovery is any operations which main outcome is that wastes can serve a useful purpose by replacing other materials which would otherwise have been used to fulfill a particular function, or waste being prepared to fulfill that function in the industrial plant or in the economy in general.Preparation for re-use is a recovery based on checking, cleaning or repairing, in which the products or parts of products that have become waste are prepared in a way that they can be re-used without any other preprocessing steps.
