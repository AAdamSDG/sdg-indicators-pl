  In connection with the Civil Status Act (datet 28th of November 2014), all births in the Republic of Poland are registered with the civil status office component for the place of birth of the child. The birth of a child must be reported to the Civil Status Office within 21 days of the date of Birth card compiled by the entity performing therapeutic activity (for a still birth within 3 days). The Birth certificate is compiled by the Civil Status Office at the same day the birth declaration takes place.The birth certificate for the child includes, among others. name and surname of the child, country, date and place of birth, sex, surname, first and last names, date and place of birth of the parents of the child. Compiling a Birth certificate for the child allows to give the PESEL number that is necessary for its identification in state registers. Situations when the birth of a child is not reported to the civil status office are treated as crimes, and may involve the case of concealment of the child, i.e. when the birth of a child occurs without the involvement of a medical subject and then the child does not use health services, educational facilities, etc. (what means lack of knowledge of child's existence).
