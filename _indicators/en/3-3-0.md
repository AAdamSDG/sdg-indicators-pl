  The Active Ageing Index (AAI) consists of 22 indicators grouped into the following 4 domains:1. Employment (employment rate of persons aged 55-59, 60-64, 65- 69, 70-74) 2. Participation in society (voluntary activities, care to children and grandchildren, care to older adults and political participation) 3. Independent, healthy and secure living (physical exercise, access to health services, independent living, financial security, physical safety, lifelong learning) 4. Capacity and enabling environment for active ageing (remaining life expectancy at age 55, share of healthy life expectancy at age 55, mental well-being, use of ICT, social connectedness, educational attainment).Each of the 4 domains was assigned a given weight:1. Employment – weight 35%,2. Participation in society – weight 35%3. Independent, healthy and secure living – weight 10%4. Capacity and enabling environment for active ageing – weight 20%.The AAI indicators were drawn using mainly 4 major European household surveys:- EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS),- EU Survey of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC),- European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS),- European Social Survey (ESS).The score of the AAI can range from 0 to 100  the higher the value, the larger contribution of ageing population to the society and better conditions for active ageing.
