  The indicator is developed on the basis of observations of prices of selected representative items of consumer goods and services in specific regions of the price survey in the country. The survey is based on the purposively selected list of representative items. Prices of goods and services are gathered by price collectors of the regional statistical offices in outlets selected within the price survey regions. While selecting regions, sales outlets as well representative items of goods and services, changes in the consumption model are taken into account. The price survey regions are settled by the CSO in co-operation with regionalstatistical offices: the region can be a city, a part of a large city, gmina or a district. The selection of outlets for recordings is made by price collectors and regional statistical offices. Price collectors are recommended to monitor prices in the same outlets during at least one year period.A centrally fixed list of representative items of goods and services remains unchanged and obligatory for all regions covered by the price surveys throughout a year. The list covers two types of representative items:- products precisely described including their specific parameters, exactly determining their features,- products representing narrow assortment groups like clothes, underwear, footwear, etc., which are supplied onto the market inshort series. Selection of a particular product or service within the group depends on a price collector’s decision.The sources of information on retail prices of goods and services are following:- price quotations carried out by collectors,- price lists, regulations and decisions applicable to the uniform prices binding throughout the country or its part issued by organs of government administration, organs of local self-governmentadministration and entities running economic activity,- price quotations of goods and services purchased on the Internet.Prices of goods and services are collected once a month, with the exception of fruit and vegetables, for which the price quotations are conducted two times a month. In case of uniform prices and tariffs the average monthly retail prices are calculated as arithmetic means weighted by a number of days of the specific price levels. The set of quotations and information on uniform prices is the basis for calculation ofaverage monthly prices of all the representative items as arithmetic means, with the number of quotations considered.A price index of an individual representative item in a region results from comparing its average monthly price with its averageprice from the base period. Country-wide price indices of particular representative items covered by the survey are computed as the geometric mean of price indices of the representative items from all the regions. They constitute a basis, for calculation, with the use of the geometric mean, of price indicesof groups of goods and services at a lower aggregation level of the weighting system. Then they are utilized (with the use of weights) to calculate price indices at the higher aggregation levels - up tothe total consumer price index. The weighting systems for the whole country and for particular voivodships are developed based on the households expenditure structure (excluding own consumption) on purchasing consumer goods and services from the year preceding the year under the survey. Data on the households expenditure structure is derived from the household budget survey. The grouping of consumer goods and serviceshas been based on the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose worked out for the needs of Harmonized Indices of Consumer Prices HICP (COICOP/HICP).
